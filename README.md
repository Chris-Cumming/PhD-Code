Will hold code used to both plot and analyse data. Thinking of using ODR as fitting function in order to allow fitting with independent variable errors included. Will also create functions used for further analysis of data - reduced chi squared, durbin-watson, etc. Will be made so that there will be a class for fitting and plotting functions and another class with functions for determining various relavent statistical parameters, lag plots, etc.
