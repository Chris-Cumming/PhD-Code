# PhD-Training-Exercise-Code
Holds the code written during the setup of the 2nd Gen Tweezer experiment which we are performing as a training exercise. This code was written specifically for use for the Rb repump laser however could easily be made more general and for other systems since the general code would be very useful elsewhere in all likelihood.
